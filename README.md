(1) (8) Given the following image, apply a grey-scale transformation function to create its negative image. Write your grey-scale transformation function and plot the corresponding transformation curve. Show the corresponding negative image. (2) (4) Print out the histogram of the original image and the histogram of its negative image.    Figure 1:  Test Image 1  (3) (9) Histogram equalization is one of the effective approaches to enhance the image quality. This assignment is to implement the histogram equalization algorithm to process the above image for better visual quality.  It is required to print out the images and the corresponding histograms before and after the histogram equalization. (4) (9) Apply the above procedure (3) to another test image (as shown below):
